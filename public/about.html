<h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
    I am a developer who has been building websites since 2021. I specialize in clean code, and a user-friendly web design, without the need to sacrifice creativity.
  </p>
 
  
  <p>
    I discovered web development in my quest to learn more about cybersecurity, and I have been hooked ever since. 
    I have learned the creative liberties you can take with web development and just how freeing and fulfilling it can be.
    From recreating the Star Wars opening crawl, to a website version of Tom Riddle's diary, creating websites has become not just a hobby, but a passion.

  <p>
    I graduated from The Ohio State University with a BA in English Literature, and I am currently pursuing a BS in Computer Science from Western Governors University.
    I specialize in front-end development and languages such as HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Python, SQL, etc.

  <h2>Beyond the Code</h2>
    <h3>Music</h3>
    <p>I have a passion for music, and especially for playing piano.
      I am fascinated by the complexity of not only classical music, but old metal music as well.
      Don't get me wrong, I would sell my soul to see NSYNC perform live, but I'd do the same for Ludovico Einaudi, Metallica, and Iron Maiden.
      My grandpa being a record collector also fueled my interest in the classics like The Ink Spots, The Platters, and Etta James.

  <h3>Books</h3>
  <p>
    It's nearly impossible to have a BA in English Literature and to not be obssessed with the classics, but the classics aren't the only genre I'm passionate about.
    Sci-Fi and Fantasy is my favorite genre, and they deserve far more attention than they get. 
    Personally, I think The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy should be mandatory in high schools, but I rest my case.
    And if you're looking for classics, look no further, I introduce you to one of the funniest pieces of literature I've had the pleasure of reading, and it's called A Modest Proposal, an essay by Jonathan Swift.
